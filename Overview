# Proven Non-Citizen Workers (PNW) Smart Contracts

## Overview  
PNW is a blockchain-based system designed to manage payroll, worker rights, and SubDAO-controlled fund allocation for Proven Non-Citizen Workers (PNW). It ensures fair wage agreements, transparent governance, and compliance with labor laws while enabling secure government verification of worker status.

## **🔹 Key Features**  

### **1️⃣ Worker Identity (NFT-Based System)**  
- Each worker receives an **NFT identity** that stores:  
  ✅ **Employment history**  
  ✅ **Visa status & expiration**  
  ✅ **Total earnings & trust fund balance**  
- Allows **governments & employers to verify work history on-chain**.  

### **2️⃣ Decentralized Payroll Processing**  
- Workers receive **USDC or other stablecoins** through the **PNW Payroll Sidechain**.  
- Employers must **pre-fund payroll** to prevent **wage theft**.  
- **2% tax from wages** is allocated to **SubDAOs**, which vote on fund usage.  

### **3️⃣ SubDAO Governance & Treasury Voting**  
- Workers participate in **SubDAOs**, which control **treasury funds** collected from payroll taxes.  
- SubDAOs vote on **fund allocation**, including:  
  ✅ **Worker benefits & emergency relief**  
  ✅ **Training & education programs**  
  ✅ **Infrastructure improvements**  
  ✅ **Investments to grow treasury funds**  

### **4️⃣ Worker Protections & Employer Accountability**  
- Workers can **report abusive employers** directly on-chain.  
- If an employer **receives multiple reports**, SubDAOs **vote on penalties** (e.g., contract suspension).  

### **5️⃣ Government API Integration**  
- Approved government agencies can **verify work & visa status** via on-chain API requests.  
- Helps with **visa renewals, tax compliance, and labor law enforcement**.

## **🔹 How PNW Works**  
1️⃣ **A migrant worker joins a SubDAO** and receives an **NFT identity**.  
2️⃣ **An employer & SubDAO negotiate salary**, ensuring **fair wages**.  
3️⃣ **Payroll is processed** on the **PNW Sidechain**, with **2% of wages going to SubDAO treasury**.  
4️⃣ **SubDAOs vote on treasury funds**, deciding **how taxes are allocated**.  
5️⃣ **Governments can verify worker status** to ensure **legal employment compliance**.

## **🔹 Smart Contract Structure**  
PNW operates across **two blockchain layers**:  
🔹 **Main Chain (Aleo – Leo Smart Contracts)** → Handles **worker identity, payroll governance, and government verification**.  
🔹 **Side Chain (Ethereum – Solidity Smart Contracts)** → Handles **stablecoin payroll processing & tax allocation**.  

### **🔹 Main Smart Contracts**
| Contract | Functionality |
|----------|--------------|
| `PNW_Main.leo` | Worker NFT issuance, payroll processing, SubDAO voting |
| `PNW_GovernmentAPI.leo` | Government verification of worker status |
| `PNWPayroll.sol` | Sidechain stablecoin payroll processing |

## **🔹 Security & Compliance**
✅ **Prevents wage theft** – Employers must **pre-fund payroll**.  
✅ **Eliminates fraud** – Government agencies can **verify work history**.  
✅ **Protects worker data** – Only **approved agencies** can access sensitive records.

## **🔹 Future Enhancements**
🔹 **Cross-chain stablecoin support** (USDC, DAI, USDT).  
🔹 **Automated employer penalties** for payroll violations.  
🔹 **AI-powered dispute resolution** for worker complaints.  

🚀 **PNW is a decentralized, fair, and transparent payroll system designed for migrant workers worldwide.**
